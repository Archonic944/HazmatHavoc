For those of you that don't know PICO-8, the (O) symbol means press Z!

Created by Archonic, VirtuaVirtue, and Pico-8 Gamer

A PICO-8 game made for LowRezJam 2023. It was finished about 20 minutes before the deadline (after a night of staying up) so expect some errors.

The main goal is to get keycards and unlock doors so you can progress through the facility and get your car keys back, but there's a twist thrown in around halfway through. Keep playing and find out!

## Info
This game was made with [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), an all-in-one fantasy console/game creation environment designed for creating and sharing small games.
